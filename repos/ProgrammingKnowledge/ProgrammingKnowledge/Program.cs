            /*is specially method,  to initialize
             * c# Will always create a constructor automatic if you don't do itself internally
             * It has the same name ass you class
             * public 
             * 
             * Constructor don't return nothing/null
             * constructor can take parameter
             * and you can write some code in the constructor
             * 
             * 
             * ~ tilt sign     *THis seems not work in VS2017
             * Constructor will never go out of scope
             * 
             * Most important use to initialize the variable in your class or value
             *
